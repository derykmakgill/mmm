title: Utility...but when?
---

Many big-block Bitcoin (BCH or BSV) investors correctly argue that Bitcoin needs to be useful as money to be valued as money. They err however in believing that something is wrong when the BTC chain is valued greater than BCH or BSV despite being currently less useful than both forks. 

Money must be useful, true, but its usefulness does not necessarily need to be immediate or present. This is overlooked by utility maximalists and alt-coin "investors." They believe that substantial price gains await after that next Github commit, because surely more utility is more value. Yet BTC continues to outperform on price because all that is required to be valuable in the present is the expectation of utility in the future.

Thus value of BTC will always be the greater until the expectation of future productivity on another coin outpaces that expectation on BTC, and any "utility" in the present on another coin can only help the value of that coin against BTC insofar as it increases the expectation of future utility.
