title: The limits are too damn low!
---

In September 2019 I wrote that I was [worried](https://twitter.com/_mkgll/status/1170906370473938944) about the lack of seriousness for removing the Bitcoin Cash block size limit.

I had seen developers and [thot leaders](https://twitter.com/vinarmani/status/1030906694216376320) argue that a 2mb soft cap on block size was not a problem because "we don't need" the capacity now. They said we could raise the limit later "when it was needed." Several of these people wrote that I was a bad actor or a BSV operative.

I promised to write a response but I thought at the time that the situation had not gotten bad enough yet to really prove my point. Sometimes people need to [learn the hard way](https://twitter.com/im_uname/status/1170907003964669953) before they're willing to understand.

I think a lot of people are learning the hard way now. Bitcoin Cash is teetering on yet another *devestating* network split that, in my opinion, will kill it. The ears

In this essay I argue that the mythical "when we need it" will never come, and that the only way to make Bitcoin successful is to remove the limits now.

>I’m the guy who went over the blockchain stuff in Satoshi’s first cut of the bitcoin code. Satoshi didn’t have a 1MB limit in it. The limit was originally Hal Finney’s idea. Both Satoshi and I objected that it wouldn’t scale at 1MB. Hal was concerned about a potential DoS attack though, and after discussion, Satoshi agreed. The 1MB limit was there by the time Bitcoin launched. But all 3 of us agreed that 1MB had to be temporary because it would never scale.

>Bitcoin as practical unit for common every days payment cheaply available to as many people as possible— practically any block size restriction is bad. It’s also completely clear to me that transaction costs— even insubstantial ones— have already turned some people off from using Bitcoin.

>Strongly agree.  My suggestion 2MB now, then 4MB in 2 years and 8MB in 4years then re-asses. 

>I believe that Satoshi expected most people to use some sort of lightweight node, with only companies and true enthusiasts being full nodes. Mike Hearn's view is similar to Satoshi's view. I strongly disagree with the idea that changing the max block size is a violation of the "Bitcoin currency guarantees". Satoshi said that the max block size could be increased, and the max block size is never mentioned in any of the standard descriptions of the Bitcoin system.”
